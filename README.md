# mazesolving-cpp
Algorithms to solve mazes from an input file written in C++.

This small project is a rewrite of this [repo](https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving/)

## Notes
When testing the algorithms make sure to use the example images provided in this repo and not the images from the original repo. It seems that the [boost](http://www.boost.org/) library doesn't support png images where the colors are indexed.
